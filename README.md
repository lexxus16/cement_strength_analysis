# Civil Engineering Cement Strength Analysis

This project analyzes the domain of civil engineering by focusing on the dynamics of concrete compressive strength in cement manufacturing. The study aims to contribute valuable insights for optimizing the manufacturing processes of this material in civil engineering.

## Introduction
This analysis utilizes the Random Forest Regressor to analyze the influence of key ingredients on the compressive strength of concrete. It focuses on uncovering the nonlinear relationships between these variables therefore contributing to a deeper understanding of cement strength in civil engineering applications. The dataset used in this analysis can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vinayakshanawad/cement-manufacturing-concrete-dataset).

## Problem Statement
**Key Variables:**
Identify the crucial variables for predicting concrete compressive strength in cement manufacturing.

**Model Performance:**
Evaluate how well these variables describe and predict concrete compressive strength.

## About Dataset
The dataset is derived from the laboratory tests, and captures the raw and unscaled data of 1030 instances, each representing a unique mixture under a specific age. The dataset features 8 quantitative input variables, including measurements of cement, blast furnace slag, fly ash, water, superplasticizer, coarse aggregate, fine aggregate, and age in days. The output variable is the concrete compressive strength measured in MPa.

- Cement: Measured in kg in a m3 mixture.
- Blast: Measured in kg in a m3 mixture.
- Fly ash: Measured in kg in a m3 mixture.
- Water: Measured in kg in a m3 mixture.
- Superplasticizer: Measured in kg in a m3 mixture.
- Coarse Aggregate: Measured in kg in a m3 mixture.
- Fine Aggregate: Measured in kg in a m3 mixture.
- Age: Day (1~365).
- Concrete Compressive Strength: Measured in MPa.
